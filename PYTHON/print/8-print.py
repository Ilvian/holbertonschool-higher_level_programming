print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World")
"""
The end parameter in Python's print function determines what gets printed after the main content.
By default, it adds a newline, making subsequent prints appear on a new line.
By changing the end value, you can control what comes after the print, like adding a space or nothing at all.
The end=" " in the first print function tells Python: 
"After printing 'Hello', just add a space, don't move to a new line."
The second print function then continues on the same line.
