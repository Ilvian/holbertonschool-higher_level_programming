### Basic Exercises:

1. **Hello World**
   - Print the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **Printing Variables**
   - Declare a variable `name` with the value "John".
   - Print the value of the variable to the console.

3. **Combining Text and Variables**
   - Declare a variable `age` with an integer value.
   - Print the text "I am " followed by the value of `age`, followed by " years old." 

### Intermediate Exercises:

4. **Multiple Variable Printing**
   - Declare two variables: `firstName` with the value "John" and `lastName` with the value "Doe".
   - Print both variables in one `print` statement to display the full name.

5. **Using String Formatting (f-strings)**
   - Declare two variables: `item` with the value "apple" and `price` with the value 0.75.
   - Print the text "The price of an apple is $0.75" using f-strings.

6. **Using `.format()` Method**
   - Declare two variables: `city` with the value "Paris" and `country` with the value "France".
   - Use the `.format()` method to print "Paris is in France."

### Advanced Exercises:

7. **Printing with Separators**
   - Declare a list `fruits` with the values "apple", "banana", and "cherry".
   - Use a `for` loop and the `print` function with a custom separator to print the fruits separated by a comma and a space.

8. **End Parameter**
   - Print the text "Hello" and "World" on the same line using two separate `print` functions but without starting a new line in between.

9. **Printing Variables in a Grid**
   - Declare a list of lists where each inner list contains three numbers (e.g., `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`).
   - Print the numbers in a grid format, maintaining their column alignment. 

10. **Dynamic Width Formatting**
   - Declare a list of strings: `names = ["Anna", "Elizabeth", "Catherine", "John"]`
   - Print each name such that they all right-align with each other, regardless of the length of the longest name in the list.

After trying these exercises, you should have a solid grasp of how to use the `print` function in Python to display text, variables, and formatted strings.
